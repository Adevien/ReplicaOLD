# Replica
This is a hobby project of mine with the goal of creating a framework for network replication using eventual consistency, aimed for games, in the beginning I'm not sure its best way to go, but for now this should suffice.

## Getting Started
There will be demos and documentation but for now the project is not even in a state of functionality that would allow testing outside the networked properties.

## Requirements
No requirements yet other than [Mono.Cecil](https://github.com/jbevain/cecil) but since this is made with Unity in mind , and unity already has a package version of it we'll use that.

## Contributing
For now there isn't much to contribute to until the whole design is layered out properly.
